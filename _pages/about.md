Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Since December 2024 I am a Research Engineer at the [Centre de Recherches sur les Écosystèmes d'Altitude (CREA)](https://creamontblanc.org/fr/) in Chamonix, France. I am working on the development of processing chains for the analysis of vegetation in high mountain environments using Lidar and optical data. I continue to be part of the development of deep learning methods for both camera traps data and acoustic sensor. I am also working deploying and maintaining the network of automatic weather stations and camera traps in the Mont Blanc massif.

Since September 2024, I am a graduate PhD student at the [LISTIC](https://www.univ-smb.fr/listic/en/) laboratory of the [University of Savoie Mont Blanc](https://www.univ-smb.fr/en/) under the supervision of [Abdourrahmane Atto](https://www.univ-smb.fr/listic/en/presentation_listic/membres/enseignants-chercheurs/abdourrahmane-atto/), [Fatima Karbou](https://www.umr-cnrm.fr/spip.php?article380) and [Emmanuel Trouvé](https://www.univ-smb.fr/listic/en/presentation_listic/membres/enseignants-chercheurs/emmanuel-trouve/).

My research interests are in the field of SAR image processing and analysis. I am particularly interested in the development of new methods for the classification of SAR images. I study the statistical properties of SAR images and their use in various machine learning frameworks. 

I am interested in their application to the study of the cryosphere, in particular the study of the wet snow cover, in both space and time at a large scale.

I previously graduated from the [Institut Physique du Globe de Paris](https://www.ipgp.fr/en/) in 2021 with a Master's degree in Remote Sensing. My master's thesis  was about robust inversion of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data and classification of GPR images.
