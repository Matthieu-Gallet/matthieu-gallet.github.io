  abstract    = {The detection of wet snow by satellite imaging is currently done in an unsupervised way and lacks quantitative evaluation due to the difficulty of collecting ground truths in extreme environments. In this article, we propose to take into account information associated with a physical model to label satellite data for the purpose of supervised learning of snow properties using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. This dataset is constructed from Sentinel-1 SAR images, augmented with topographic information obtained from a digital elevation model. The labeling of this data is done at the scale of the Northern Alps using the CROCUS physical snow model. Then, we trained, over 13 combinations of labeled dataset, a wide range of machine learning models to quantitatively identify the most relevant learners for the wet snow detection task. The results demonstrate consistency among the different algorithms, with significant improvement observed when incorporating polarimetric combinations and topographic orientation data in the input of the model. The best algorithmic solution trained on this dataset is evaluated by comparing the obtained wet snow map over a validation area in the French massif of the Grandes Rousses with the existing Copernicus products, fractional snow cover, and SAR wet snow. We also compare the temporal results obtained at one meteorological station located in the test area. The results show a better representation of wet snow during the melting period using the supervised learning approach, as well as a reduction in areas classified as wet during the winter season.},

  abstract    = {We consider the problem of classifying a pair of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images by proposing an explainable and frugal algorithm that integrates a set of divergences. The approach relies on a statistical framework that takes standard probability distributions into account for modelling SAR data. Then, by learning a combination of parameterized Renyi divergences and their parameters from the data, we are able to classify the pair of images with fewer parameters than regular machine learning approaches while also allowing an interpretation of the results related to the priors used. Experiments on real multi-class data demonstrate the virtues of the suggested method when compared to both Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classifiers, showing its resilience to disturbances such as polluted labels and variations in the percentage of training data.},

Pour cette détection, on utilise un RADAR GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) qui émet une onde qui va traverser le sous sol et se réfléchir sur d'éventuels objets enterrés. A cause du mouvement du RADAR la réponse de ces objets a une forme d'hyperbole. L'approche proposée dans ce papier est basée sur un modèle convolutif avec dictionnaire et une matrice rang faible. Le problème d'optimisation utilise une norme d'Huber à la place de la norme classique pour avoir une meilleure robustesse au bruit qui est très présent dans une image GPR. Nous testons notre approche sur un jeu de données réelles fourni par la société Géolithe et montrons l'apport de la norme de Huber par rapport à la norme classique. },

  author      = {Gallet, Matthieu and Mian, Ammar and Ginolhac, Guillaume and Ollila, Esa and Stelzenmuller, Nickolas},
  abstract    = {In this paper, we propose two algorithms to enhance the interpretability of the hyperbola in B-scans obtained with a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). These hyperbolas are the responses of buried objects or cavities. To correctly detect and classify them, a denoising is typically necessary for GPR images as the signal-to-noise ratio is low, and the various interfaces naturally present in the earth have a strong response. Both algorithms are based on a sparse convolutional coding model plus a low rank component. It is solved through an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework. In order to take into account the presence of outliers and the artifacts caused by the acquisition, the second algorithm is based on the Huber norm instead of the classic L2 -norm. These algorithms are tested on a real dataset labeled by geophysicists. The results show the denoising efficiency of this approach, and in particular the robustness of the second algorithm. },

The CNN was trained to classify the wet snow conditions based on features extracted from the SAR images, using both the VV,VH channel and the ratio between these channels and those of a reference image in summer. One of the key points of this work is the comprehensive comparison we have made between the performance of the CNN method and other advanced statistical methods.We found that the CNN was able to achieve good accuracy in wet snow classification, and giving a complementary vision of the solutions obtained by other machine learning algorithms such as the Random Forest classifier. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of using CNNs and SAR images for wet snow classification and highlight the importance of using physical information model for training machine learning models in snow state identification, a domain where collecting ground truth is intricate due to the complexity of the snowpack moisture measurement systems. },
